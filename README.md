Abstract: MSDS6306: Doing Data Science - Case Study 01: Beer & Brewery. I cleaned the data and performed EDA to view distribution (log transformed when necessary) and relevant summary statistics. I conducted various hypothesis tests, k-NN cross validation on normalized values, linear regression model, and correlation tests to derive r, its p-value, r squared. Lastly, I examined the geographical distribution of IBU in order to recommend appropriate beer attributes that cater to the unmet needs of the regional markets.

## Contents of repository

1. Datasets: Beer & brewery csv files  
2. Codes: RMD, knitted html
3. Presentation: PDF of powerpoint, recorded presentation, plotly of IBU distribution by cities

## Summary of findings

- ABV and IBU are linearly correlated  
- Ale and IPA styles have different median ABV and IBU values
- Number of breweries per city and maximum IBU are linearly correlated

## Conclusion
